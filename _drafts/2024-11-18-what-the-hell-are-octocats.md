If you've used GitHub for any length of time, you've probably seen their odd "Octocat" logo. This cute little icon also has a _lot_ of bizarre variations, here's an explanation of them all!

The full list of Octocats [is available in GitHub's "Octodex"](https://octodex.github.com/), and they may be used to refer to GitHub or as a _personal_ avatar picture, but (unsurprisingly) not for commercial purposes or physical products. They're very, very cool, and they definitely deserve a bit more visibility. Maybe this article will help!
