## Good

### Import from LastPass includes categories, and even tags the import date

* Although does want to do LastPass login... with 2FA.

### Free trial with no credit card

### Extremely user friendly

### Watchtower is great

## Bad

### Doesn't understand Android logins

### Doesn't understand local IP logins

### Reused passwords

* Doesn't understand "safe" reuse across multiple domains
* Deleting a duplicate keeps one of them

### Charges in dollars, and doesn't show tax until country selected
