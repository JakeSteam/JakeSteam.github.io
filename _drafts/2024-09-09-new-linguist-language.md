## Todo

- Set up GitHub Codespace to work in https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

- REQUIREMENTS
  - Find a "grammar"(?) (maybe just VSCode repo? Look at existing)
  - Find real-world samples
  - Create a "heuristic": https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/heuristics.yml
    - "on x" events work well, a few options: https://github.com/JakeSteam/junkbot-code/blob/main/files/editor/parent_edit%20manager.ls
  - Show "in the wild usage": Ideally 200 user/repos, or 2k instances
