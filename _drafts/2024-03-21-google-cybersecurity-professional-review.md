Did you know Google offers a Cybersecurity Professional Certificate? They do! I recently completed it, and wanted to share the good, the bad, and the confusing parts.

Before diving into the review, it's worth mentioning that the learning platform used for this (Coursera) has a very rewarding referral program, but **referral links are NOT used** in this article. This way, the review is guaranteed to be impartial.

## Overview

A few useful links before going into detail:

- [Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity)
- [An example of the final certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/GLBE227BHPQ9) (mine!)
- [My notes made throughout the certificate process](https://github.com/JakeSteam/cybersecurity-certificate-notes), organised by course.

I won't cover all the basic information around the objectives of each module, or the areas covered, since this is all available on the official site. Instead, I'll cover all the things that _aren't_ discussed, far more interesting! However, it is worth referencing Google's summary of the certificate objectives:

> Understand the importance of cybersecurity practices and their impact for organizations.
>
> Identify common risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as techniques to mitigate them.
>
> Protect networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access and cyberattacks using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.
>
> Gain hands-on experience with Python, Linux, and SQL.

### Duration

The description of [Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity) states "6 months at 7 hours a week". This simply isn't close to accurate, and is many times higher than the actual time required, regardless of experience levels.

Each of the 8 courses consist of 4 "modules", in theory a week of work. In reality each module will take around an hour of work, perhaps two for the very technical modules for complete newcomers. This gives a total time of around 32 hours (8 x 4), rounded down to 30 due to the last course containing far less detail. Nowhere near the ~180 estimated!

32 hours is roughly a work week, and I can see from my notes that I completed the course in 16 days (20th March - 5th April). During this time I was also working on an unrelated university project (and have a job!), so my personal estimate with a lot of relevant existing knowledge is around 20 hours.

In conclusion, 20 - 40 hours to complete is more accurate, depending on experience.

### Pricing

The certificate is served on Coursera, and whilst you _can_ pay for access to the certificate itself ($49/month), it costs about as much as a month of "Coursera Plus" ($59/month) which provides access to the certificate and hundreds of others.

As such, Coursera Plus seems to make far more sense if you intend on completing any additional courses whatsoever, otherwise you'll end up with overlapping $49/month subscriptions!

**[ CLARIFY FREE TRIAL, can take for free then pay for cert, etc ]**

### My background / aims

As hinted at earlier, I knew that this course would have quite a bit of overlap with my existing knowledge. I've worked as a software engineer for 10+ years, and have a personal interest in cybersecurity, encryption (my BSc Computer Science dissertation was on this!), and similar topics.

However, as with a lot of my tangential knowledge, it's been picked up at random through articles, conversations, and experiences at work or on side projects. This left me suspecting there might be some fundamental gaps in my knowledge, and this certificate confirmed that!

I'd estimate around 30% of the course was new to me. Whilst the Python ([Course 7](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automate-cybersecurity-tasks-with-python?specialization=google-cybersecurity)), SQL ([Course 4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linux-and-sql)), and web portions were more of a refresher than anything new, the areas around incident detection and response ([Course 6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/detection-and-response)), and assets / threats / vulnerabilities ([Course 5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities?specialization=google-cybersecurity)) were completely new information, with the other modules being a mixture.

With all that preamble finished, on with the actual review!

## The Good

### Varied, high quality content

People have different preferred learning styles, and I sometimes "bounce off" training courses because I don't particularly enjoy videos, and far prefer reading or interactive activities. As such, I was very impressed with the variety of formats, and how it was all extremely consistently excellent.

For example, whilst core information is often provided in a video, it's almost always expanded on in far more detail in text / graphic form in the next activity. This serves as a recap, clarifies any misunderstandings, and lets you absorb a bit more surrounding information.

In total, the formats offered, in approximate order of frequency, are:

#### Videos

Typically 2-8 minutes long, with a relevant Google employee on camera. These will often include animations, diagrams, or code when helpful, and are clearly filmed and edited professionally. More on these in [Videos](#videos).

#### Readings

Usually 100-800 words, with relevant diagrams and links. The writing is very high quality, easy to understand, yet also accurate. In fact, despite usually finding plenty, I didn't spot a single spelling mistake throughout the entire certificate! I wish these readings were provided as standalone content, as they're some of the best summaries I've ever seen.

#### Quizzes

These are short, 4-8 question multiple choice quizzes around recently covered content. They're quite easy, usually require a 75% pass rate, and can be retaken if failed.

#### Flashcards / Plugins

There's a few formats of these, but they all revolve around clicking to view summaries of information learned. They all contain high quality artwork, and are useful recaps.

#### Portfolio builders

After learning about a new type of documentation (e.g. incident report), there'll be a self-marked assignment to create an example of this documentation, with an example provided afterwards. I admittedly skimmed these activities usually, since they were quite a lot of paperwork that I've completed in the real world before.

#### Lab activities

Some technical content, such as learning Linux, Python, or SQL, had an interactive lab activity available via "Qwiklabs". The Linux labs especially were very well-structured, more on those in [Linux labs](#linux-labs).

### Videos

- Content is engaging and extremely varied, including mini-quiz inside videos etc
  - Video, reading, quizzes, flashcards, lab activities
- Subtitling, playback speeds etc are great. Combined with more detailed reading after videos is a good combo.

### Ambitious scope

- You will learn the basics of SQL, Python, cybersecurity, etc

### Recurring host

- Each course has a central host, helping centre the whole thing, with guest speakers for bits

### Linux labs

- Linux's labs are great, including the leaderboard etc. Requires actual understanding, and is more "real world". Commands can be copied, yet still require thought.

### Connected modules

- Some information-dense modules (e.g. all of 3) are explained very well, better than I experienced at uni, and far more efficiently.

### Realistic

- Realistic, sites like Reddit / Stack Exchange are mentioned. Similarly, Google products are mentioned when appropriate (Google Sheets or LibreOffice), it's not blatant advertising.

## The Bad

### Very easy

- It's very easy, due to ability to retake all exams, and no peer review.

### Focus on individuals

- Heavy focus on diversity, everyone is welcome, varied career paths, personal stories.

### Length

- Much, much shorter than advertised (ahead of the game, you got this). 45m for 9m quiz. 30m for ~6m reading.

### Discussions

- Discussions are pointless (discussions.png)

### Learning Python

- Not sure Python in a Jupyter notebook is the best way to learn.

### Wireshark tutorial

- Windows labs just didn't work for me for Wireshark tutorial.

## The Confusing

### Talking speed and tone

- Absurdly slow talking speed, highly scripted. The occasional unscripted normal speed interview is startling!
- Somewhat infantilizing tone of voice:
  - "You did a fantastic job adding new knowledge to your security analyst toolkit ... Keep up the great work!"
  - "Wow, well done!"
  - "I really enjoyed debugging this code with you"

### Occasional focus loss

- Occasionally loses focus on cybersecurity, and becomes generic career advice (resume, cover letter, etc). Presumably due to completely new target audience.

### Distracting cast

- Diversity... 80-90% women, at least as much focus on background as actual content. This extends to flashcards etc where a single scene will have someone in a wheelchair, someone with a hearing aid, and someone in a Hijab, none white. First time I've ever noticed it. A deaf guest speaker?

### Unneeded emails and notifications

- Ending course and starting next results in email spam (joining course spam)

### Varying technical expertise

- Sometimes the technical expertise targeted varies massively. For example, 4.1 contains the extreme basics of what is an OS... and then talks about virtualization and hypervisors! Similarly, 5.4 talks about reflected XSS attacks, and also how to determine URL in an email link.

- Page mentions interview prep, career support, resume review... do these exist?
