intro, mention not using referral program

## Overview

- mention notes repo
- mention content of course
- mention duration, link to later discussion of length
- link to certificate

## My background / context

## The Good

- Content is engaging and extremely varied, including mini-quiz inside videos etc
  - Video, reading, quizzes, flashcards, lab activities
- Video, text, animation are extremely high quality. So many bespoke animations / graphics!
- You will learn the basics of SQL, Python, cybersecurity, etc
- Subtitling, playback speeds etc are great. Combined with more detailed reading after videos is a good combo.
- Each course has a central host, helping centre the whole thing, with guest speakers for bits
- Some information-dense modules (e.g. all of 3) are explained very well, better than I experienced at uni, and far more efficiently.
- Linux's labs are great, including the leaderboard etc. Requires actual understanding, and is more "real world". Commands can be copied, yet still require thought.
- Realistic, sites like Reddit / Stack Exchange are mentioned. Similarly, Google products are mentioned when appropriate (Google Sheets or LibreOffice), it's not blatant advertising.

## The Bad

- It's very easy, due to ability to retake all exams, and no peer review.
- Heavy focus on diversity, everyone is welcome, varied career paths, personal stories.
- Much, much shorter than advertised (ahead of the game, you got this). 45m for 9m quiz. 30m for ~6m reading.
- Discussions are pointless (discussions.png)
- Windows labs just didn't work for me for Wireshark tutorial.
- Not sure Python in a Jupyter notebook is the best way to learn.

## The Confusing

- Absurdly slow talking speed, highly scripted. The occasional unscripted normal speed interview is startling!
- Occasionally loses focus on cybersecurity, and becomes generic career advice (resume, cover letter, etc). Presumably due to completely new target audience.
- Ending course and starting next results in email spam (joining course spam)
- Somewhat infantilizing tone of voice:
  - "You did a fantastic job adding new knowledge to your security analyst toolkit ... Keep up the great work!"
  - "Wow, well done!"
  - "I really enjoyed debugging this code with you"
- Diversity... 80-90% women, at least as much focus on background as actual content. This extends to flashcards etc where a single scene will have someone in a wheelchair, someone with a hearing aid, and someone in a Hijab, none white. First time I've ever noticed it. A deaf guest speaker?
- Sometimes the technical expertise targeted varies massively. For example, 4.1 contains the extreme basics of what is an OS... and then talks about virtualization and hypervisors! Similarly, 5.4 talks about reflected XSS attacks, and als how to determine URL in an email link.
