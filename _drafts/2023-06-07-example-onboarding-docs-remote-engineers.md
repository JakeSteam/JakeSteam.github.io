intro (mention not HR stuff, just team stuff, also only relevant for teams without defined process?)

## Previous approaches

* All sync: Lost knowledge, misconceptions, lots of time & effort
* Basically none: Chaotic, massive gaps
* One big, extensive doc (or list of useful notion pages): Bits get skipped, too much at once

## Priorities

* Async (with sync for catchups)
* Useful for all members
* Always up to date
* Time boxed (doing x per day)
* Clear, not overwhelming
* Mention docs for developers book!

maybe mention learning styles, how I massively prefer written info

## Day by day

### Day 1

### Day 2

### Day 3

## Meetings

* Product
* Design
* Software

## Improvements to make

* Overwhelming w/company onboarding, underwhelming if used alone
