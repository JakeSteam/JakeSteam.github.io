Emojis are fun. As weird as it sounds, custom emoji reactions are one of the main reasons I find Slack and Discord so comfortable to use in comparison to things like Microsoft Teams! So, what makes custom emojis such a useful, even essential feature in a chat platform?

## Why do emojis matter?



### Team identity

When working closely with others for long periods of time, you naturally form some concept of "us", or "the team". Having emojis based on this team that can be used in day to day situations helps reinforce this identity, no matter how basic they are.

For example, on a quiet day I added a varied set of Android emojis to my employer's Slack. Whilst these are usable by anyone, realistically they'll mostly be used by Android developers, or those working closely with the Android app.

After I'd used them 1-2x to get the word out, I started seeing them pop up on anything Android related! There's something oddly heartwarming about seeing your team's little "Android with sunglasses" icon being used by hundreds of people on app-related company announcements etc.

* Talk about "thankyou", "ta", "yes", "no" emotes
