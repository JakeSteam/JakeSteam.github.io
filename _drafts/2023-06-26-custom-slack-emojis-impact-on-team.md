Emojis are fun. As weird as it sounds, custom emoji reactions are one of the main reasons I find Slack and Discord so comfortable to use in comparison to things like Microsoft Teams! So, what makes custom emojis such a useful, even essential feature in a chat platform?

## Why do emojis matter?

I ü•∞ love ü•∞ emoji reactions way too much, hopefully this article can provide some justification for this perspective! 

### Team identity

When working closely with others for long periods of time, you naturally form some concept of "us", or "the team". Having emojis based on this team that can be used in day to day situations helps reinforce this identity, no matter how basic they are.

For example, on a quiet day I added a varied set of Android emojis to my employer's Slack. Whilst these are usable by anyone, realistically they are mostly used by Android developers, or those working closely with the Android app.

After I'd used them 1-2x to get the word out, I started seeing them pop up on anything Android related! There's something oddly heartwarming about seeing your team's little "Android with sunglasses" icon being used by hundreds of people on app-related company announcements etc.

### Inclusiveness via inside jokes

Working in tech, there's often a system that is unreliable or problematic for various reasons. This might be a third party system, a legacy system, or just one that is performing a tricky task. When the point of failure is recurring, having a "fun" emoji to defuse the frustration somewhat genuinely helps! 

This might be sarcastic (e.g. a system that often appears to be the cause, but is often just a symptom), or genuine (e.g. `blame-user`). Either way, having an emoji that lets technical & non-technical people allude to this without resurrecting a "X is unreliable" discussion every time can ease frustration.

Using individuals is generally not advised (see [riskiness of faces](#riskiness-of-faces)), but otherwise the mixture of sarcastic and genuine sentiment lets anything be safely blamed!

### Low friction engagement

As a team grows beyond single digits, it's just not possible for 20 people to all reply to messages. Emojis, especially custom additions, let anyone agree with a sentiment very quickly without having to overthink their wording.

For example, on two new engineers' first day I announced them in our team chat. Without emojis it would have had very few reactions, since there's not much to realistically comment on, but a collective üéâ & üëã is a nice hello for the new joiners!

You might also notice the seemingly inexplicable pig reaction... This will make more sense after reading [microcomedy opportunity](#microcomedy-opportunity) & [passively shaping culture](#passively-shape-culture), but essentially it's a pun on the new starters being "guinea pigs" (testers) for a new onboarding guide I'd created ([more info](/example-onboarding-docs-remote-engineers/)):

As another example, when an Android colleague was leaving the Android "heart" emoji was a cute addition to the standard ‚ù§Ô∏è:

This part is also crucial when a team includes quite reserved or private individuals. Whilst they may not want to send a reply to a message in a large channel, they're probably willing to do a single click to add an existing reaction! Whilst this is a microengagement, in my opinion it's significantly better than zero engagement.

### Microcomedy opportunity

Okay, admittedly this one is definitely only applicable to some people, but personally I can't resist the opportunity to make a bad pun. Reactions let you do that without disrupting conversation, with decoding the joke being a bonus side-quest!

In the following example, certain processes go through a "Change Approval Board", AKA CAB. When a reminder about this was posted, obviously the only appropriate reaction was a taxicab emoji... üôÑ

### Passively shape culture

If your team has appealing emojis, they will be used. 

The company "Moonpig" has a cute pig as their mascot. Since we previously shared a Slack space with them, we still have all their emojis, and they still get used pretty regularly due to being high quality animations. 

Whilst creating quality branded animations is perhaps only worth doing in a designer's spare time, having employees *wanting* to use the company mascot helps reinforce this branding internally. This will inevitably feed into the company's interactions with the public, and when going "all-in" enough on your mascot to make it part of your company name, why not set it up for success?

If your company doesn't have a mascot that needs representing, emojis can still absolutely be used to influence overall culture. For example, we currently have the most common reactions immortalised in ultra basic and readable emojis. These can then be used as reactions either in private messages (saving a bit of time / brainpower thinking of a text reply), or in a group chat (letting multiple people say the same thing easily).

The reason this is so important is due to the passive nature of the influence. Adding the emojis and using them a few times doesn't require a meeting or any documentation, appealing ones will naturally spread widely. For example, I added an upbeat "bouncing sun" to use during some hot weather, and before long it was regularly used for anything summer related!

### Communication subtlety

Using emojis as reactions allows a new dimension of communication besides plain text. This could be asking general questions (e.g. "üëç/üëé" or "üçï/üçú/ü•™"), or even judging team sentiment. Whilst this applies to all emoji reactions in general, it applies especially to custom emojis.

Additionally, in a direct message reactions let a past message be reacted to without disrupting the current topic. This is useful when something doesn't justify a thread, but a quick üôÑ or üòÇ shows it has been acknowledged!
