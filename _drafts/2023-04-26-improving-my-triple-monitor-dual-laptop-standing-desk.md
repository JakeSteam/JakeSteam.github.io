Exactly [2 years ago](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/improving-my-windows-macos-triple-monitor-working-from-home-setup/), I wrote about my revamped WFH setup. Now I've moved... everything has changed again! Here's everything wrong with my old setup, and how I built the new one.

## Requirements

As a reminder from the last post, I have a weird working setup where I use a (personal) Windows machine and (work) Macbook all day. I also need to frequently be on video calls.

## Before

First up, here's my old setup which was... okay:

## After

And here's the new one:

## Changes

Okay so yes, pretty much everything has changed!

### Environment

Yes, I've moved! I'm now in a dedicated office with lots more space, shelves where I want them, soft carpets, etc. I'll do a full room tour eventually, but for now the main improvements are:

* **View**: A large window looking out over my new garden, where my cat Cassie is often hunting leaves or similarly dangerous prey.
* **Lighting**: This large window also means I have natural light on my face, with the option of additional soft lighting from a lamp. Much better than the monitor-lit face before, now I have more options than washed out / in darkness.
* **Creativity**: Having more space means I can have a basic whiteboard up on the wall for notes / UI sketching, and my old desk can become a big space for... something.

### From PC to Laptop

Since moving out of a small 1-bed apartment into a house with plenty of places to work, I was spending almost none of my free time in my office. In fact, I was using my work laptop just to watch Netflix or reply to emails in other rooms. 

In addition to a lack of flexibility, my mid-range "gaming" PC was a few years old so performed worse than a 4 year old macbook for everything except gaming! Considering how I only play a few hours a week and don't care much about graphics, it seemed time to purchase my first ever personal laptop.

After plenty of research ([asking Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/11hxgfn/uk_16_1k_looking_for_a_windows_replacement_for_my/), then Googling lots of dumb questions before coming to the same conclusion...), I bought the Lenovo Thinkbook 16p. The vendor I used was selling their last few models at a crazy discount, so I got a new £1.3k machine for under £900! I still haven't seen another deal under £1k, and it has everything I need:
* 16" screen, so it's portable but doesn't feel cramped.
* Air intake on the bottom, so I can mount it under the desk.
* Great CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX), a [staggering 6x better](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/3870vs3045/AMD-Ryzen-9-5900X-vs-Intel-i5-7640X) than my old CPU..!
* Great GPU (RTX 3060 Laptop), around [30% less powerful](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-3060-Laptop-vs-Nvidia-RTX-2070S-Super/m1452971vs4048) than my old GPU, but enough for 60 fps on Forza Horizon 5 on high.
* A [very detailed review](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkBook-16p-in-laptop-review-A-crowd-pleaser-if-you-re-ready-for-some-compromises.560656.0.html) mostly highlighted flaws I don't mind (poor webcam, few ports, etc).

The stereotype of a relatively powerful laptop that can also run games is an angular, LED-covered bulky monster, with deafeningly loud fans. There's always one student in a university lecture who deeply regrets their noisy Alienware laptop! Luckily the Thinkbook 16p has: 
* No fans when under light load. 
* A professional, "normal" design.
* No LEDs (although there is a backlit keyboard that has to be disabled).

### Desk & mounting

Yep, that's a standing desk. I've wanted one for a while, and moving seemed like the time to make the change over to a Flexispot E7. I've also got Flexispot's cable tray to bring some sanity to my cables.

### Monitor wiring

With the old setup, 2 of my monitors had 2 cables coming out of them, one to each machine. This plus power cables meant... a lot of cable management. With the new setup, each of the multi-machine monitors only has 1 DisplayPort -> USB C cable that can then be swapped between machines.

This avoids the issue of my mouse sometimes going to an invisible monitor (e.g. not the currently selected monitor input), and also allows any other USB-C output device to be easily plugged in.
