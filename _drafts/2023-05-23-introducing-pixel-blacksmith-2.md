7-8 years later, it's time for a sequel to a project I worked on obsessively, which taught me all the basics of Android development and publishing!

I first got into Android development 7-8 years ago, and learned entirely through building my game Pixel Blacksmith in my spare time. Having a project like that *really* helped provide the motivation & direction for learning, and the fact that it became surprisingly successful (and profitable!) undoubtedly helped my career.

So, since I'm moving back into Android development (from management) in July, what better time to relearn Android with a sequel?

## Overview

So what is Pixel Blacksmith 2? Well, it's a layered idle / incremental game.

The vision is to end up with multiple layers of cohesive games, with each layer having multiple playthrough / automation options.

For example, the first layer "Machine" is a puzzle-solving layer. Whilst this can be manually solved by solving all the puzzles, it can also be automated via each "path". Unlocking additional solving options will require a specific manual action, so players will need to balance the ease of automation with the control of manual completion.

## Project goals

Similar to Pixel Blacksmith 1, this project has a number of goals that mostly align:

### Learning

Realistically I'm no longer on the "cutting edge" of Android development. I missed most of [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), I haven't tried [version catalogs](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs), and I'm just generally behind the curve on most developments in the last few years.

By utilising all of the latest and greatest technology in this project, I can get myself back up to speed. I've always found Google's codelabs and tutorials miss a lot of the "real world" issues that will be encountered, hence the benefits of having an actual project.

### Testbed

When a new technology is announced, it's hard to find a use for it without a modern codebase. If you're working in an outdated codebase, there's no point paying attention to new libraries since... you won't be able to use them. 

Having a modern project means new libraries can be tried out, whilst the fact it's a personal project means unstable APIs can be deployed into production. Google IO etc will suddenly become a lot more relevant!

### Users

I haven't dealt with "real users" in a while. During Pixel Blacksmith's peak I was replying to (usually positive!) customer feedback most days, and it was honestly enjoyable. Having real people caring about what I did, minus all the "protections" you get in a larger company was extremely motivating. Fixing a bug became a thing people cared about, not just a ticket on JIRA.

As my new job is at a startup I'll likely be a bit closer to our userbase, and having recent experience with the positive & negative pressures this entails can't hurt. 

### Money

Realistically, Pixel Blacksmith never made *that* much money. However, it would be nice to have a side income, although it's unlikely to even pay minimum wage for the hours worked!
