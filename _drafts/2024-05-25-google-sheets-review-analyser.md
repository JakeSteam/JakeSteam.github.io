I recently rebuilt the primary customer complaint within an app, and instantly solved all their related issues ðŸŽ‰. However, I wanted to quantify this, by analysing the app's reviews.

## Scenario

- Mention Google Play matching terms, but not really working well for totals / expansion
- Mention it was payments
- Mention filtering by version

## Exporting data

- Link to previous post

## Using analysis template

- Link to public example

## How it works

- filter not regex match?
