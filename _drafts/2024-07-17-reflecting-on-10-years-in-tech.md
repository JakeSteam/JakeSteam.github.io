This August marks exactly 10 years since my first software development job! I've hopped between industries, companies, and seniority a lot in this time, constantly learning more about what I want from a career.

## 2014 - 2017: First Option Software

### What was the role?

As a **Software Engineer** I usually led work on the absurdly varied software systems used by a building surveyor for insurance claims, later on building an Android app for a social media company.

### What was the best & worst part?

The best part was the sheer variety of technology used, most of which had to be learned from scratch! It's pretty rare even a full-stack fresh graduate gets to lead projects in Java, C#, PHP, SQL, and more on a daily basis, adding in VB6, ColdFusion, Android, iOS after a couple of years.

The worst part was the lack of guidance. As great as it was running massive, important projects by myself, and I learnt massive amounts daily, I did a lot of "cowboy coding" with nobody to show me better! With no code reviews, no seniors to learn from, and no personal objectives, it was nevertheless an excellent first job.

### Why did I leave?

**Money and specialisation.** I self-taught myself Android outside of work, and building my games (e.g. [Pixel Blacksmith](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.jakelee.blacksmith)) made me realise it was possible to actually _enjoy_ software development, plus get paid more than negligible graduate wage for it.

### What career lesson did I learn?

**Take an interest in your own career.** Your employer will take your preferences into consideration, but ultimately if you want to 2x, 3x, 4x your salary and/or work in a new area, you need to make that happen yourself.

## 2017 - 2018: Creators.Direct

### What was the role?

I founded a content creator startup with a friend, so I was **Co-Founder / CTO**. Realistically this involved everything technical, plus comms, legal, finance, management, and towards the end literally everything!

### What was the best & worst part?

The best part was utilising my full-stack experience to build the backend, database, iOS app, Android app, client site, and having the complete control and vision over how the entire system operates and grows.

The worst part was... infinite essential work, and finite time to do it. With my (sales & product) co-founder leaving early, I ended up spending half of my day fielding client emails, handling contracts, and contacting leads, and the other half building 3 large projects (Android / iOS / Web) and the backend to support them! Turns out 1 person can't do the work of an entire team, regardless of hours worked.

### Why did I leave?

**Workload and dwindling resources.** Since I'd work 16-20 hours, then sleep for 8, my body clock became completely detached from reality, and I'd shift a few hours later every day, waking up at arbitrary times of the day / night. This lifestyle plus barely making enough revenue to pay rent let alone save any wasn't sustainable mentally, physically, or financially.

### What career lesson did I learn?

**Be realistic with burnout.** If you're working ridiculous hours and aren't enjoying the work, you can't escape this by... working even harder. You need to delegate, offload responsibilities, take a break, or do whatever you need to protect your own mental health.
