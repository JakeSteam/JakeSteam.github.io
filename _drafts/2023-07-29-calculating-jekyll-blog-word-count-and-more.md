I've been writing blog posts for quite a few years, and when a single post can easily be thousands of words... my total word count must be in the hundreds of thousands! To find out, I expanded an existing Jekyll plugin's functionality, here's how to use it ðŸ“Š

## The plugin

The base of this post's work is (author!) [Matt Gemmell](https://mattgemmell.com/)'s [`Jekyll-Posts-Word-Count` plugin](https://github.com/mattgemmell/Jekyll-Posts-Word-Count), *however* we'll be [using my fork](https://github.com/JakeSteam/Jekyll-Posts-Word-Count) since it adds a ton of functionality.

The original plugin hasn't had more than minor updates in 9 years(!), yet it still works perfectly. The beauty of simple, functional code, huh?
