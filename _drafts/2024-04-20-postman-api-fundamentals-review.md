Misc notes

- Very advert-y!
- There's a whole graphic novel..? https://api-first-world.com/
- Forgot I had an account!
- Screenshots are close to actual appearance, but icons are shuffled around, my UI is dark mode (with no way to toggle?).
- The sample data being shared is risky... it's primarily many many copies of To Kill A Mockingbird!

## Request parameters

Relying on google.com?q=x is risky, and breaks if any cookie notices etc are there. A typical user isn't gonna know what the error means.

Is it trying to teach you Postman, or requests & responses in general? Meanders between the two.

Why are the videos screen recordings at 2880x1800 exported to gif? Some of them are 10mb, and totally unnecessary!

It's also trying to teach JS!?

## Halfway test

OK the testing by forking a test suite collection and using an API key based URL as `{{submission}}` to pass all tests was nice.

- Plus, submitting via customised email etc body!? Very cool.

Great that the "final exam" requires you to use what you've learned, and convert words into actions.

## Limitations

Shame it doesn't cover environment, or any other advanced postman tech.

There are great next steps available e.g. https://academy.postman.com/path/engineer-learning-path, but these aren't linked anywhere...

Or, even the oher bit of the student academy, a project: https://academy.postman.com/project-ai-text-summarizer
