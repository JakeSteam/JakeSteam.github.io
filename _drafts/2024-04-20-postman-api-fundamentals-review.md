Misc notes

- Very advert-y!
- There's a whole graphic novel..? https://api-first-world.com/
- Forgot I had an account!
- Screenshots are close to actual appearance, but icons are shuffled around, my UI is dark mode (with no way to toggle?).
- The sample data being shared is risky... it's primarily many many copies of To Kill A Mockingbird!
