I've been using Chrome since release, and rely on the password manager daily. As you might expect, after 14 years I built up a lot of saved passwords (1000+)! However, migration to a proper solution is long overdue, here's how I did it and tidied up my passwords at the same time.

## Backstory

Considering how much of my life is online, and how security conscious I am, using Chrome's Password Manager was always a guilty secret. I almost always use unique passwords, always use 2FA, and even use a unique email per service (so the source of any spam emails can be identified). However, a lot of sites still don't support 2FA, so all it would take to compromise an unknown number of my accounts is one bit of malware. Uh oh.

Whilst my Google account is secure, can I really be as confident in my personal machine / phone, both of which have access to all those passwords at any time? Probably not. As such, I decided it was time to finally migrate to a "proper" solution. I went for LastPass as it was very highly rated, easy to use, and supported all operating systems I work on. It might not be the cheapest, but $3 vs $5 per month really isn't much for a comfortable password management experience!

However, I need to get my 1000+ Chrome passwords over thereâ€¦
