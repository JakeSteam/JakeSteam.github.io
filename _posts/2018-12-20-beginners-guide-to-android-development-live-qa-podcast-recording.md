A couple of months ago the guys at [Enhance.co](https://enhance.co/) hopped on the [Android Dev Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/TnJRnf4) and took a few questions from the members there. After a few delays this 90 minute podcast is now [up on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jakesteam/android-dev-podcast), and embedded below!

The podcast covered topics from game engines and Flutter to app publishers and testing, many thanks to the hosts!
