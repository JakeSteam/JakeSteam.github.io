A couple of weeks ago I [created a list of Jerma fan channels](https://channels.jerma.io/), as there's a pretty obsessive fanbase. Since The Yogscast has 30+ members, there's a lot more original content coming out, making them an excellent candidate [for a similar project](https://yogscast.jakelee.co.uk/)!

The project is of course [open source again](https://github.com/JakeSteam/Yogscast), and can be accessed at: **[yogscast.jakelee.co.uk](https://yogscast.jakelee.co.uk/)**

It seems to be going down [fairly well on the Yogscast subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/165g7b7/i_created_an_adfree_automatically_updating_list/), hopefully the community finds it useful. Enjoy!
