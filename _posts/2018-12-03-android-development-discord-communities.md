Whilst developing for Android, it's often necessary to ask others for help, or discuss concepts / news. Whilst [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android) is excellent for solving problems long-term, sometimes it's easier to talk through something in realtime. To that end, [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is an excellent resource, this post will introduce a few of the larger communities.

I currently help moderate all of these communities, so feel free to message me on Discord (@JakeSteam#9845) with any questions!

## Android Development Servers

[Android Dev](https://discord.gg/TnJRnf4): This is the main Android development server. With over 3,000 members, the #beginner and #intermediate rooms have helpful people available 24/7. There are also specialist rooms to discuss libraries like #firebase and #dagger, and lots of information in #useful-resources. Finally, there is also #promotion, #app-showcase, and #hiring to promote various types of content.

[Flutter Dev](https://discord.gg/qgs7DNe): Whilst smaller than the main server (1.6k members), the specialised nature of the server (Google's Flutter framework) means it is much more helpful than the #flutter channel of Android Dev. As it is part of the same server network as Android Dev ([Devs on Discord](https://discord.gg/B5YCN6N)), they share the same channel structure.

## General Android Servers

[/r/Android](http://discord.gg/android): This massive server (12k users) is loosely affiliated with the subreddit, but has a very different tone. With very relaxed rules, most of the conversation ends up happening in #offtopic.

[/r/AndroidGaming](https://discord.gg/Fa9ahHK): This server (1.4k members) focuses on gaming news and discussion, as well as game recommendations and sharing content. Special roles are available for YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and game developers.

[/r/AndroidQuestions](https://discord.gg/Cw62EkV): This server is quieter than the others (500 members), and is full of people asking questions, and a few helping. Generally the subreddit is a better place to ask, but it can't hurt asking here too.
