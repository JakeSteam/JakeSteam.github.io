As anyone could probably figure out from my [thousands of YouTube video views](https://jakelee.co.uk/analysing-my-youtube-subscriptions/#viewing-the-spreadsheet) and [hundreds of hours on Twitch](https://jakelee.co.uk/analysing-my-twitch-data/#analysing-my-own-data), I'm a big fan of Jerma985. Since there's... hundreds of fan channels, it's easy to miss some amazing content, so I created a complete(ish) list!

It's at ~~*[jerma.jakelee.co.uk](https://jerma.jakelee.co.uk)*~~ **[channels.jerma.io](https://channels.jerma.io)**.

Since it's just a simple GitHub pages site & open-source (~~*[repo](https://github.com/jakesteam/jerma)*~~ [repo](https://github.com/JermaSites/channels)), hopefully others add channels too, otherwise... I'll look a little bit obsessed. Oops. 

There's also links to 4 Jerma games, and all kinds of bizarre soundboards / tools / utilities. Eventually I might hook it up to a GitHub Action using YouTube's API to update the video & subscriber counts, but that's only worth the time investment if it becomes a useful resource.

*Edit: I **did** hook this up to a GitHub Action! A full write-up [has now been published](/fetching-youtube-metadata-in-github-actions-and-persisting/).*

Anyway, enjoy!
